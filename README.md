# 🧮 Akan Name Generator

## 📝 Project Description
The Akan Name Generator is a simple web application that calculates the
day of the week a user was born and assigns them an Akan name based on
their gender. Akan names originate from Ghanaian culture, where children
are traditionally named according to the day of the week they are born.

This project demonstrates the use of HTML forms, CSS styling, and
JavaScript logic such as functions, arrays, control flow, operators, and
input validation.
